A spell pack addon for Electroblob's Wizardry, adding spells and artefacts based on the Mowzie's Mobs mod. 

Mo' Spells is a Minecraft version 1.12.2 modification which adds magical content to your game.

**This mod requires both the [Electroblob's Wizardry mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/electroblobs-wizardry) and the [Mowzie's Mobs mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mowzies-mobs).**

Content added by this mod includes new summonable variants of Mowzie's mobs, [spells](https://github.com/Electroblob77/Wizardry/wiki/Spell-Book), and unique artefact items.
